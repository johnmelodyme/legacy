# Roachbot

This robot was intended to roll around in an office full of cubicles and annoy people.  I never quite got him working in that role.  He was more of a demo robot.  But he was able to roll around, beep, and back away from obstacles when he got stuck.  A PIR sensor on his head was added so he could sense people.  Then he would emit 85db beeps.
