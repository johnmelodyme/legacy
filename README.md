# legacy
Legacy code from a variety of projects.

I've built a variety of clocks, robots, and other gizmos with a variety of microcontrollers.  Some are still functional and may need support.  Unfortunately, some of these projects may no longer exist.  But if I find old code for one of these projects, I will put it here.

In the olden days, my "version control" scheme was to copy a file or directory and give it an increasing suffix (like 1,2,3 or A,B,C) to make it different from the previous one.  You'll see lots of that in these folders.  Sorry.

In this repository, you'll mainly find code for Parallax controllers (BS1, BS2, and BSX) and Acroname BrainStem controllers (GP and Moto).
