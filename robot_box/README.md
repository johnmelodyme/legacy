# Box

This was one of my very fist programmable robot projects.  All it does is roll back and forth.  It doesn't even have any steering.  It has a hall effect sensor that detects when one of its wheels is spinning.  If the wheel isn't spinning then the robot is stuck.  It reverses direction.  The act of smacking into things can change its direction.

In a later version, I added a light sensor so it can try to find a dark place and hide or sleep.
