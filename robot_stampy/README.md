# Stampy

He was my entry in the 1999 Trinity College Firefighting Home Robot Contest.  He waddled around on two big feet and used his big heavy head as a counterweight to help him balance.  He used a UVTron ultraviolet flame sensor and a second IR phototransistor sensor to detect candle flames.  A third sensor let him know if a very bright light was right in front of him (like a candle).  Then he used a fan to blow out the candle.  He also has wall following sensors.

His "brains" were a BASIC Stamp 2 for high level logic, a BASIC Stamp 1 for leg control, and an off-the-shelf servo motor controller with a serial interface.
