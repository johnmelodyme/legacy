# GPS Boat

This was an autonomous boat that used a compass and GPS for guidance.  I programmed it to follow a diamond-shaped path around a small lake.  It was slow, but once I had everything tuned, it was very reliable.  Every 10 seconds or so, it would use GPS readings to check if it was still heading towards its next waypoint.  Between readings, a compass loop kept it on the previous heading.

I think the files with three-letter names starting with "gb" contain the most recent code.
