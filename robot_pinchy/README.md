This was a robot for the 2009 Trinity College RoboWaiter contest.  He wall-hugs to a table, finds a beacon, goes through some scripted motions to grab a plate with some cereal, then wall-hugs back the way he came.  He uses a compass to measure relative turn angles.  Some IR rangefinders measure distance to the wall or table top.  A phototransistor circuit detects the beacons.
