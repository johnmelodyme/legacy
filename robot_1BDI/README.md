# 1-BDI

This was my second robot for the 2001 Trinity College Firefighting Home Robot Contest.  This project was a bit too ambitious.  It used a BX-24 controller to talk to a RAMCAM camera.  I tried to find a "bright spot" in the image which would hopefully be where the candle flame was.  It needed lots of tuning and I never got it working properly at the contest.
