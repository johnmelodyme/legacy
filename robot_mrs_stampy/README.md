# Mrs. Stampy

This was a robot for the 2000 Trinity College Firefighting Home Robot Competition.  She's an upgraded version of Stampy with more brainpower and speed.  Stampy graciously gave her his UVTron ultraviolet flame sensor.  It's for detecting the presence of a flame somewhere in front of her.  It has a very wide field of view so she has to pan with a sensor that has a much narrower field of view in order to figure out where the flame is.  A fan blows out the flame.  She also has a wall following sensor and a white line detector in her tail.
